# Forms of the Evar

**This is _very_ pre-alpha right now and not really usable at the moment.**

## What you will need to run this

You must install Staticmatic in order to generate the HTML and CSS files.

    gem install staticmatic

Run `staticmatic preview .` in the root of the project directory to setup a server at localhost:3000
